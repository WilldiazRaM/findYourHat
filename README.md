## Game Rules

- The player is represented by the character '*'.
- The hat is represented by the character '^'.
- Holes are represented by the character 'O'.
- The field is represented by the character 'â–‘'.

## How to Play

1. The game initializes with the player ('*') in the top-left corner and the hat ('^') placed randomly on the field.

2. The player must navigate through the field using the following commands:

    - 'up': Move the player up.
    - 'down': Move the player down.
    - 'left': Move the player left.
    - 'right': Move the player right.

3. If the player finds the hat ('^'), they win and the hat is repositioned randomly on the field.

4. The game continues until the player decides to exit.
